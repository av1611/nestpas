Description: This collection of aliases make certain operations more natural
    and expressive with the 'magrittr' pipe operator. The collection was previously
    included in 'magrittr', but is now provided as a separate package.
    Examples are `add` for `+`, `extract` for `[`,
    and to explain the name `nes't pas` for `!`.
